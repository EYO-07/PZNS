# PZNS
A new framework or platform for managing, spawning, and directing NPCs in Project Zomboid

This is an effort to standardize NPC management and spawning while offering the flexibility to all modders the ability to create and modify NPCs to their content without worry about all the complicated issues such as AI behaviors, data management, and decompiling PZ source code.

All functions in PZNS will have working examples for modders to follow so that they create and spawn their own npc creations in-game.
